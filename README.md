# Module-1---Challenge-1

# Description

The focus of this Challenge is rewriting an existing code with more semantics in mind. Also, HTML did not specify the name of the website, as well as certain parts (a and p) in CSS were misplaced.

# Work Overview

Firstly, I had changed the title of the website to Horiseon Social Solution Services.

Secondly, I started to change the divs. I started with body, where I changed div which related to the top of the page with header. Then, I changed ul and li with nav. After that, I changed divs with sections. Within sections and nav containing images and href attributes I added alts. I changed the largest div with main, I changed a div responsible for the side of the page with aside. The last section of the body was switched from div to footer.

Thirdly, I looked at CSS file to see if it is all in correct order and copied and pasted a and p to be next to the body, so it is more semantic.

Fourthly, after checking my work, I saw that nav bar was not grouping on the right side of the header, so I inserted into CSS float parameter for nav.

# Final Thoughts

It was interesting to change the code for the first time in the more semantic way. It made me understand how to better utilize basic commands in HTML, as well as paying attention to parameters that I had to fulfill to pass the Challengel.
